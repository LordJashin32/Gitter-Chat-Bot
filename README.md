sudo apt install pypy3 python3 python3-dev python3-pip
pip3 install setuptools wheel chatterbot chatterbot_corpus

cd Gitter-Chat-Bot
python3 ./main.py

```
Make sure to fill in your Gitter API Key, and Room ID for
your usage. 

## Usage

This can be used for a variety of purposes but remember that nothing trumps real human interaction. So if you are trying to get people for something it might be better to handle that yourself than to use a bot.
